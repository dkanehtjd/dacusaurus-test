// This strategy creates a flat list of files that have notion-id for file names.
// Pros: the urls will never change so long as the notion pages are not delete and re-recreated.
// Cons: the names are human readable, so:
//    * troubleshooting is more difficult
//    * is less "future" proof, in the sense that if you someday take these files and move them
//    * to a new system, maybe you will wish the files had names.

// TODO: for this to be viable, we'd also have to emit info on how to build the sidebar, because
// the directory/file structure itself is no longer representative of the outline we want.
